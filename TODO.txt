I am seeing some 500 Internal Error from the Darwin server. Not sure if
its because I am sending crap in my request due to an uncleared buffer
or something. It usually happens right after I lose a connection.





Implement an RtspProducer class which does the RTSP ANNOUNCE and
RTSP RECORD process.
