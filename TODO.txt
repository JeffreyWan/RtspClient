Modify the HeaderParser to ONLY use service provider impls. Get rid of the concept
of a default provider. Implement an HTTP provider, an InternetMail provider, and a
RTSP provider. Since RTSP and HTTP are very very similar the headers from RTSP that
are not part of HTTP should be the only ones implemented in the RTSP provider impl
and the remaining should be part of the HTTP provider.
